    <div id="sigma">Freedom

Maren stood at the edge of the cage, staring out at the world beyond. It was a world he had never seen, only heard about. People called it “outside,” but for him, it was just a dream. His life had been spent inside these cold walls, a place where freedom didn’t exist. But today... Today, something felt different.

He remembered his father’s words: “One day, son, you will see the world. You will break free.”

But Maren always thought it was just a fairy tale. The walls were too high, and the guards too strong. No one had ever escaped. But Maren was tired of waiting. He was done with being trapped. And today, he decided he was going to break out, no matter what.

With shaky hands, he grabbed the small metal rod he had hidden under his bed. He had spent weeks preparing, carefully chiseling away at the lock. It wasn’t easy, but Maren was determined. He had to do it. He needed to see the world.

Finally, with one last twist, the lock clicked. The cage door opened. It was like waking up from a long nightmare. His heart raced in his chest. Freedom, it felt like air for the first time in forever.

Maren stepped outside, blinking in the bright light. It was too bright, too much, but he didn’t care. He had done it. He was free. The ground beneath him was soft, the grass cool against his skin. The wind felt alive, like it was speaking to him.

He didn’t know where to go, but that didn’t matter. He just had to move. There were no walls, no bars, nothing to hold him back. His eyes searched the horizon, and then he saw it.

A mountain. Tall and mighty, its peak lost in the clouds. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Maren couldn’t explain it, but something about it called to him. He knew he had to climb it. He had to see what was at the top.

With every step he took, the world seemed bigger. The trees were taller, the sky bluer. He walked for hours, not caring about the time, not caring about the hunger or the pain in his legs. He was free.

As he climbed, memories flooded his mind. His childhood, the cold cage, his father’s words, the longing for something more. He had spent so many years wondering what was out there. And now, he was finally going to find out.

The air grew thinner, and the wind howled around him. But Maren didn’t stop. He couldn’t. Not now. He was so close.

At the peak, he stood for a long time, just looking. The view was unlike anything he had imagined. The land stretched out below him, vast and endless. The sun was setting, casting a golden glow over everything. It was perfect. He had never seen anything more perfect.

Tears filled his eyes. It was like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. For the first time in his life, Maren understood what it meant to be truly free.
        
He whispered to the wind, “This is it. This is the world.” And for the first time, he smiled.
