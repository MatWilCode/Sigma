Editing Process
Arrange what you have written in the appropriate order. Make sure to incorporate your revisions into your body paragraphs, or delete them if you don’t want to use them. This list shows you how the pieces you have written will go together:

Introduction
Body paragraphs with revisions and in the order you prefer
Conclusion
Read your essay aloud to listen for how sentences work and flow for your reader:

Is it clear how each sentence follows from the sentence before it? Rewrite sentences in order to make that connection obvious to the reader.
Does your writing sound like a written essay or do you have any words and phrases that sound out of place in a school essay? To establish and maintain a formal style, avoid using the first or second person point of view (do not say "I" or address your reader as "you") and remove any slang or informal language.
Make sure you have punctuated and cited your quotations correctly. Click Next to refer to the Guidelines for Citing and Punctuating Direct Quotes and to make sure you have written your direct quotes correctly.

Make sure you begin every sentence with a capital letter and end every sentence with appropriate end punctuation.

Correct any errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar that you can find.
