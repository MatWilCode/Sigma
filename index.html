To control the Jews, the Nazis used strategies such as propaganda and impoverishment.

One strategy the Nazis used was propaganda. They made posters and graffiti that showed Jews as bad people and Germans as healthy and hard-working. In Shores Beyond Shores, Mutti says there where anti-Jewish posters everywhere, and it was scary, especially for children. This made people think Jews were dangerous and made Germans feel better than Jews. Because of this, Jewish families became treated unfairly.

﻿

Another strategy was impoverishment. The Nazis took away Jewish businesses and jobs, which made life harder for Jewish families.﻿﻿﻿ During Kristallnacht, Jewish stores were destroyed. This caused many Jewish people to lose money. By taking away their jobs, the Nazis made Jews weaker and easier to control.
