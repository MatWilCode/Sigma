The purpose of the speech “After Auschwitz” by Elie Wiesel is to make people remember what happened in Auschwitz. He wants people to remember the victims and their suffering. For example, he says, “Listen to the silent screams of terrified mothers.” This shows people suffered a lot. He also wants people to learn from the past so it doesn’t happen again. He says, “For the sake of our children, we must remember.” This means remembering is important for the future.
